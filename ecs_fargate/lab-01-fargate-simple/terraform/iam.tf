# IAM — Roles and Policies
#
# There are TWO distinct roles in ECS Fargate:
#
# 1. Task Execution Role: used by the ECS AGENT to:
#    - Pull the image from ECR
#    - Send logs to CloudWatch
#    - Read secrets from Secrets Manager (if needed)
#
# 2. Task Role: used by YOUR APPLICATION to call AWS services
#    (S3, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.).
#    Empty here because the app does not need AWS access.
